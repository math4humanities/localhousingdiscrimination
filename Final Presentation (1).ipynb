    "   Homeownership is known as a vital driver of wealth creation, and even considered the epitome of the American Dream. However, since the 1960's there has exsisted a consequiental gap between white homeowneship and black homeownership. In fact, the gap is even wider today. I wanted to visualize the lending discrimination that is evidently taking place. Housing and lending discrimination practices such as redlining have made a disparate impact on the ability of Black-Americans to build equity. Despite the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the presence of such practices are still at an all time high. I truly believe if the homeownership gap were to close we'd be a big step closer to racial equity.\n",

    " My plot depicts a relationship between four different variables: race, income, debt-to-income, and property value. On the x-axis is the debt-to-income percent which is plotted against the y-axis which represents income by the thousand. Then, color accounts for race, and size accounts for property value. As portrayed on the plot, a large majority of denied black applicants are clustered on the bottom left of the plot. Being on the bottom left of the plot implies a desirable debt to income ratio, <40%, paired with a lower income, <100k. However, it's important to note the size of the data points in this region. The stars are small which implies the property values were all less than 400k.Even points outside this region that can be considered outliers were also quite interesting to observe. For, these applicants although have a sub par debt-to-income ratio they both had wise income-property value values.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Lending companies are known to prioritize debt-to-income ratios over credit scores, so my plot portrays that black applicants are often times denied mortgages without adequate reason. I also included other races such as White and Asian to emphasis this is not always the case. A majority of White and Asian data points were on the right hand of the screen, and the average size of a data point is also significantly greater in terms of property value.\n",
    " \n",
    " As predicted the dataset supports the idea that Black populations are more likely to be denied a mortgage despite being in sensible financial standing to do so. I acknowledge that my dataset has numerous limititations, and there are many other external factors I did not observe that can contribute to the nature of my plot. I was not surprised, however, I did find it noteworthy that this was just one bank and a small group of appplicants, yet the data was strong enough to still exibihit a pattern of prejudice.It goes to show how widespread and common these issues are."
